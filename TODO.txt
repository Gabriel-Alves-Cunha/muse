* FIX: font with I and L different!!
* ADD: loader on lyrics searching!!!
* ADD: options to search results!
* FIX: when ctrl+a with options open, everything is selected!!!!
* FIX: change from mouse or touch events to something that WebDevSimplified talks about!!

### NOTES:

1. `const { getState: getPage } = usePage;
		// and then:
		getPage().page
	 ` is not reactive!

2. `const { isLoadingMedias } = usePlaylists();`
		will rerender not only with `isLoadingMedias`,
		you have to use a select function.
